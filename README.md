# ml_basics

This repository works to implement fundamental supervised and unsupervised machine learning models in plain Python. Ten of the most widely used methods are created as follows:

1. Linear regression
2. Logistic regression
3. Decision tree
4. SVM algorithm
5. Naive Bayes algorithm
6. KNN algorithm
7. K-means
8. Random forest algorithm
9. Dimensionality reduction algorithms
10. Gradient boosting algorithm and AdaBoosting algorithm
